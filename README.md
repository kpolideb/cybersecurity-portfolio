# About Me


**Name:** Kristi


**Hometown:** Kansas City, KS


**Prior IT Experience:** My experience in IT has primarily been mostly as a casual troubleshooter with my own devices.  It wasnt until I became a victim of cybercrime that I developed a passion for understanding and safeguarding my own technology. That experience opened my eyes to the risks and real life drama of the cybersecurity world.  As I began digging into what had happened to me and became and investigator and detective in my own story; an awareness and sense of purpose took over in me.  I became fascinated and focused on understanding how it happened and how I could fight it in the future for me personally and others.


**Career Plans:** My goal and dream is to gain the cybersecurity skills to combat human trafficking.  My vision is to combine my background in behavioral health and trauma informed psychiatric care with my firsthand knowledge of the cybercrimes commited against me. Empowered by the skills gained in the COR cybersecurity program my goal is to be a unique and highly effective force against human trafficking.


**Proud Project/Task:** Im pround of myself for stepping into a field I once thought was beyond my ability and reach.  Over the last year...driven by the need to discover what was happening to me, and then to understand how it happened...  I discovered I was capable of digging into technology and I actually enjoyed it.  The injustice I experienced and the personal connection to the harm done, somehow unlocked a feature in my brain I dont think I would ever have had access to before. I have decided I am not letting it be wasted. Im proud of myself for choosing to take the worst thing that has ever happened to me...and turning it into a new career path that othersise wouldnt have been possible and Im going to walk in it with purpose.
